## Children
Children have needs that you should take care of:
* They will sleep once in a while.
* They need to eat, hungry children get unhappy.
* They want to stay happy. Sad children will run away!

## Rooms
So how to build your orphanage:
* Dorm: Allow you to house more orphans, they go here to sleep.
* Kitchen: Feed the children, this room needs an employee.
* Play Room: Playing here will make kids happy.
* Classroom: Increase the education of the kids to improve the chance for adoption. This room also needs an employee.
* Janitor: Keeps the rooms clean and functional. Needs an employee.

Each time a room gets used it gets dirty or damaged. 
This will make future uses less efficient until the room gets attention by an janitor.

## Employees

To hire employees you need to have the required room.
Employees of higher level will increase the efficiency of a room but also ask for more salary.

## Money

Things that will cost you money:
* Hiring new employees will cost their salary as sign up bonus.
* Building a room.
* Monthly salary.
* Fines for children that ran away.

How to get money:
* Government funding. The more children are living in your orphanage the bigger the budget.
* Adoption donations. Parents will donate on adoption, they will be more delighted about educated kids.
